## Meeting
**Present**: Lina, Rofaida, Szymon, Cara

## Meeting time:
- Best slot seems to be on Mondays around 18:00 (maybe 18:15 or 18:30)
- We will vote in the group chat

## R-workshop
- It was successful
- It would be nice if we could repeat it

## Pub Crawl
- Leaders:
    - Nicolai
    - Rofi
    - Lina 
- Add reminders about weed rules to Instagram on the day/the day before 
- Discussed the option of posting the schedule of what group will be where at what time and adding phone numbers of the group leaders, so they can easily be reached if someone gets lost

## Instagram
- Add some people that participate more actively in the weekly meetings (Lina, Szymon, Cara)
- We might have to remove some people who currently have access, but only if there is a limit on how many devices can be signed in at the same time and we happen to cross it
  
## Moodle
- Rofi will go sign the form to create a Fachschaft Moodle tomorrow (24th) and then give access to the rest
